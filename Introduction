The purpose of this project is to design and implement a continuous-time Proportional–Integral–Derivative (PID) controller using analog circuitry. The controller is realized using operational amplifiers configured for proportional gain, integral action, and derivative compensation. The objective is to demonstrate classical control concepts through a practical analog implementation, evaluate closed-loop performance, and compare theoretical predictions with simulation and hardware measurements.
