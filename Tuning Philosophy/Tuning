The tuning strategy for the analog PID controller follows a structured approach where each term is introduced gradually and only after the previous term has been characterized. Tuning begins with proportional control alone. By adjusting the proportional gain Kp, the system is made sufficiently responsive to track the reference input without entering sustained oscillation. High Kp values reduce rise time and increase stiffness, but also increase overshoot and can destabilize the loop if the gain exceeds the phase margin imposed by the plant and hardware non-idealities. Observing the transient behavior at different Kp settings gives an intuitive understanding of the plant dynamics and establishes a baseline for subsequent tuning steps.
Once a usable proportional response exists, integral action is added to eliminate steady-state error. The integral gain Ki is increased until the tracking error collapses to zero, which verifies that the loop has sufficient low-frequency gain. However, excessive integral gain slows settling and introduces oscillation due to the additional phase lag contributed by the integrator. In an analog system this behavior is visible as ramping and wind-up on the integrator node, which makes over-tuning immediately obvious on the oscilloscope. The goal is to add just enough integration to remove steady-state offset without compromising damping.
Derivative action is incorporated last to control overshoot and improve damping. Because the D term reacts to d/dt(e(t)), it anticipates sharp transitions from the reference and opposes rapid changes in error. This shortens settling time and suppresses ringing when tuned correctly, but also amplifies high-frequency noise and injects spikes during discontinuities. In practice, derivative gain is increased only to the point where overshoot and oscillatory behavior are minimized, after which additional filtering or compensation may be required. This incremental P → PI → PID tuning sequence reflects how continuous-time control loops are tuned in real hardware: adjust responsiveness first, enforce accuracy second, and then shape transient behavior and damping last.
