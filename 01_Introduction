PID (Proportional–Integral–Derivative) controllers represent one of the most widely used closed-loop control strategies in engineering. Their adoption across power electronics, motion control, robotics, process control, and instrumentation stems from their simplicity, robustness, and effectiveness in regulating physical systems. Although modern implementations are commonly digital and embedded in microcontrollers or DSP platforms, the classical continuous-time analog realization remains fundamental to understanding how PID control interacts with real-world dynamics.

This project implements a fully analog PID controller using standard operational amplifiers and passive components to realize continuous-time P, I, and D actions. The objective is to study the theoretical basis of PID control, physically realize the controller in hardware, analyze its behavior for a variety of input stimuli, and observe how non-idealities such as slew rate, bandwidth limitations, component tolerances, and noise influence loop performance.

The build consists of an error computation stage, a three-stage PID summer, buffering, and a first-order RC filter to stabilize derivative action and suppress high-frequency artifacts. Square and step responses are used to characterize system behavior, demonstrate steady-state error elimination, and tune dynamic properties such as rise time, overshoot, and settling.

Through this project, classical control theory is connected directly to tangible circuit behavior. The results highlight both the elegance of continuous feedback control and the practical challenges of analog system design, including stability margins, parameter trade-offs, and hardware constraints. This serves as a hands-on exploration of control systems from first principles, bridging theoretical analysis with experimental validation on real hardware.
