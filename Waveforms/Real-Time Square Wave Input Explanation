**Objectives**

The objective of this experiment is to analyze the response of the RC plant to a square-wave input. Square waves contain abrupt transitions and a rich harmonic spectrum, making them particularly effective for evaluating the plant’s transient behavior, rise-time characteristics, and inherent low-pass filtering action.

**Experimental Setup**

low-frequency square wave was generated using a function generator and applied to the input of the RC plant. The corresponding output voltage across the RC network was observed using a digital storage oscilloscope.

Input signal (CH1 – Yellow): Square wave from the function generator
Output signal (CH2 – Blue): Voltage across the RC plant
Operating frequency: Approximately 2.5 Hz
Measurement mode: Time-domain observation

**Observations**

Edge Smoothing and Attenuation
The sharp rising and falling edges of the square-wave input are significantly smoothed at the output. This behavior is characteristic of a first-order RC system, which limits the rate of change of the output voltage in response to sudden input transitions.

Exponential Charging and Discharging
The output waveform exhibits exponential rise and fall segments following each input transition. These segments correspond to the capacitor charging and discharging through the resistor with a time constant T=RC

Amplitude Reduction
The peak-to-peak amplitude of the output signal is reduced relative to the input. This attenuation results from the suppression of higher-frequency harmonics present in the square wave.

Phase Delay
A measurable delay is observed between the input transitions and the corresponding changes in the output waveform, indicating a phase lag introduced by the RC network.

Linear Operating Region
The absence of clipping or distortion confirms that the plant is operating within its linear range during the experiment.

**Conclusion**

The response of the RC plant to a square-wave input demonstrates clear first-order dynamics characterized by exponential charging and discharging, amplitude attenuation, and phase delay. These results validate the RC plant model and provide essential insight into the transient behavior that must be addressed during PID controller tuning.
