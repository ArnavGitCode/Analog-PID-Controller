In this test, the square wave serves as the reference input signal, representing a sudden change in commanded value with instantaneous rising and falling edges. The blue waveform is measured at the output of a first-order RC network that acts as the plant. Because a physical RC cannot respond instantaneously to a square input, the output follows a characteristic exponential trajectory during both charging and discharging intervals. This creates the familiar first-order step response shape, where the waveform rises toward the new level with a time constant t=RC, and then decays with the same time constant when the input transitions low again.
This behavior highlights the fundamental difference between ideal command signals and real plant dynamics in closed-loop control systems. The square wave contains high-frequency components and effectively demands infinite dv/dt , while the RC network limits its bandwidth and cannot reproduce those high-frequency transitions. The result is that the plant smooths the square wave into a rounded exponential curve, demonstrating that real systems always introduce inertia, lag, or filtering characteristics. In control terminology, the plant output is underdamped but monotonic, with no overshoot, and exhibits nonzero rise and fall times determined by t.
From a feedback perspective, this waveform makes it clear why a PID controller is useful. The proportional term would reduce the rise time but cannot eliminate the residual steady-state error introduced by the finite slope. The integral term would accumulate the tracking error during each transient and drive the plant to match the command more closely, while the derivative term would inject anticipatory correction to counteract the lag inherent in the RC dynamics. Thus, even without closing the loop in this measurement, the waveform visually communicates the “actuator lag” or “plant limitation” that the PID must overcome for accurate tracking. This makes the RC response a practical and intuitive stand-in for real physical plants such as motors, heaters, or mechanical servos, where dynamics are similarly first-order or higher.
