In a continuous-time PID controller, the input to the control law is the instantaneous error signal e(t)=r(t)−y(t), which represents the difference between the commanded reference and the measured plant output. The proportional block acts directly on this error, producing a correction 𝑃=𝐾𝑝*𝑒(𝑡) that is proportional in magnitude and immediate in response. Increasing Kp makes the controller more aggressive, reducing rise time and increasing responsiveness, but cannot eliminate steady-state error and may introduce overshoot or sustained oscillations if pushed too high. The proportional term is therefore the primary “muscle” of the loop, applying force proportional to the current deviation.
The integral block responds to the historical accumulation of error rather than its instantaneous value, producing I=Ki​∫e(t)dt. This block continues to increase its output as long as error persists, which eliminates steady-state offset that would remain under proportional control alone. The integral term boosts low-frequency gain and drives the plant output toward the reference over time, but in excess can slow settling and introduce oscillatory behavior due to phase lag and reduced damping. In analog hardware, the integrator physically stores the accumulated error on a capacitor, making the control memory visible on the oscilloscope as a ramping signal.
The derivative block acts on the slope of the error, producing D=Kd*d/dt(e(t)). Instead of reacting to what the error is or has been, it predicts where the error is heading, allowing the controller to apply anticipatory correction before large deviations occur. Derivative action improves damping and reduces overshoot by opposing rapid changes in error, and its effect is most conspicuous when the input is a square wave, where it generates sharp spikes at transitions. However, because differentiation amplifies high-frequency components, the D term is sensitive to noise and is typically filtered in real analog designs. Together, the P, I, and D blocks transform the error into a control effort that balances responsiveness, precision, and stability, enabling accurate tracking of the commanded signal across both transient and steady-state conditions.
