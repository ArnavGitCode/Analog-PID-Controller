The breadboard layout follows a left-to-right signal flow consistent with the schematic, with the PID stages distributed across the main row of the board. The two DIP op-amp packages are positioned centrally with enough spacing to accommodate the passive components that implement the proportional, integral, and derivative terms. Their placement suggests that each IC is responsible for a subset of the PID blocks rather than mixing functions, which helps avoid unintentional coupling between high-frequency derivative nodes and low-frequency integrator nodes. The wiring between stages is kept relatively short, which reduces parasitic inductance and external noise coupling—important for analog feedback systems.
Power rails appear to be routed along both sides of the board with red and black jumpers, providing a clear and consistent reference for Vcc and ground. This ensures that the op-amp stages share a common reference point, preventing DC offsets that could otherwise accumulate through the integral term or push the op-amps into saturation. Decoupling capacitors are placed near the op-amp ICs (visible as the small green capacitors), which helps to stabilize the supply rails and reduce oscillations caused by rapid current transients, especially from the derivative stage. Signal lines are routed using color-coded jumpers, with purple and black wires forming the primary inter-stage connections and indicating the feedback and summer paths.
The overall physical organization demonstrates awareness of analog layout principles: the buffer/output stage is placed toward the right-hand side for convenient probing and interfacing, while the main PID computation remains central. The board spacing also allows oscilloscope probing at intermediate nodes, enabling the user to observe proportional, integral, and derivative contributions individually before they are combined. This layout reflects both the logical control architecture and the practical need for debugging access in a continuous-time feedback experiment.
