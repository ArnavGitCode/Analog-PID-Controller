Building a continuous-time PID controller in analog hardware exposed the differences between ideal control theory and the physical behavior of real circuits. One of the first insights was that derivative action is extremely sensitive to noise and discontinuities. While simulations show clean differentiated edges, the breadboard implementation produced large spikes during square-wave transitions and amplified high-frequency noise from the function generator and power rails. This made it clear why analog derivative terms are often filtered or replaced with lead compensation in industrial controllers.
Integral action also behaved differently in hardware than in theory. In continuous time, the integrator accumulates error indefinitely, and small offsets from component tolerances or ground potentials produced visible drift and wind-up on the oscilloscope. This demonstrated how low-frequency mismatch can destabilize an otherwise functional loop and why analog controllers frequently implement anti-windup mechanisms or clamping in practical systems. The exercise also highlighted the trade-off between eliminating steady-state error and maintaining good damping and settling time.
Finally, the project emphasized the importance of bandwidth, phase margin, and parasitics in feedback systems. The RC plant introduced lag, the op-amp introduced additional phase shift through finite gain-bandwidth product, and the breadboard introduced parasitic capacitances and coupling paths. These effects ensured that tuning could not rely solely on equations; instead, iterative adjustment and empirical observation were required to achieve a balanced response. Overall, the project provided a hands-on perspective on classical control, demonstrating that robust feedback design is as much about understanding physical constraints as it is about manipulating transfer functions.
