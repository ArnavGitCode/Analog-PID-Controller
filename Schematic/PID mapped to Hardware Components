In this analog implementation, the proportional, integral, and derivative gains map directly to resistor–capacitor ratios in the op-amp stages. The proportional gain Kp is realized using the closed-loop gain of a non-inverting or inverting amplifier, where Kp=Rf/Rin. Adjusting either resistor changes the loop stiffness and alters rise time and overshoot. This mapping makes proportional gain the simplest to tune, as it involves only resistive scaling rather than introducing frequency-dependent behavior.
The integral gain Ki corresponds to 1/(RiCi) in the active integrator stage. The resistor at the input defines how much of the error signal is fed into the capacitor, while the capacitor sets the time constant over which error accumulates. Decreasing either Ri or Ci increases Ki, strengthens low-frequency loop gain, and drives steady-state error toward zero, but excessive integral gain reduces damping and may introduce sustained oscillations. In Laplace form, this appears as Ki/s, with the pole at the origin created by the RC network.
The derivative gain Kd is implemented by placing the capacitor in the input path and the resistor in the feedback path of an active differentiator. The ideal form Kds emerges from the product RdCd, but in practice a small additional resistance (or RC network) introduces a finite high-frequency roll-off to prevent amplification of noise harmonics. Decreasing 𝑅𝑑 or Cd lowers the derivative action and softens the damping effect, while increasing them raises Kd and sharpens the system’s predictive correction.
Together, these mappings enable the classical control law u(t)=Kpe(t)+Ki∫e(t)dt+Kd*d/dt(e(t)) to be realized using linear analog components without discretization or numerical approximation. Practical tuning becomes a matter of adjusting resistor and capacitor values, providing a direct and intuitive bridge between continuous-time control theory and physical circuit behavior.
