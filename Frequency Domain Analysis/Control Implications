The experimentally obtained Bode characteristics of the RC plant reveal a clear magnitude attenuation and phase lag within the operating frequency range. As expected for a first-order low-pass system, the plant exhibits a monotonic decrease in gain with increasing frequency and a corresponding increase in phase delay. These properties fundamentally constrain the achievable closed-loop performance, as excessive phase lag reduces stability margins and limits the maximum allowable controller gain before the onset of oscillatory behavior.
The observed phase lag has direct implications for controller structure selection. Pure proportional control is insufficient to achieve accurate tracking across a wide frequency range, as increasing proportional gain to reduce steady-state error simultaneously pushes the system closer to instability due to accumulated phase delay. This behavior motivates the inclusion of derivative action, which provides phase lead and partially compensates for the plant’s inherent lag, thereby improving transient response and increasing phase margin without excessively amplifying low-frequency gain.
The magnitude response further highlights the trade-off between bandwidth and noise sensitivity. While increasing controller gain extends the effective closed-loop bandwidth and improves tracking of faster reference variations, it also amplifies high-frequency noise components that are otherwise attenuated by the plant. This trade-off underscores the necessity of careful tuning, particularly of the derivative term, to avoid excessive noise amplification while still achieving acceptable dynamic performance.
Overall, the frequency-domain analysis provides a clear rationale for the use of a full PID controller in this system. The proportional term addresses steady-state accuracy, the derivative term compensates phase lag and enhances stability, and the integral term (introduced cautiously) eliminates residual steady-state error. By linking measured gain and phase characteristics to controller design choices, this analysis ensures that PID tuning is grounded in the plant’s physical dynamics rather than empirical trial-and-error.
