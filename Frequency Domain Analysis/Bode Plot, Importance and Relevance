A Bode plot is a frequency-domain representation of a system’s behavior, consisting of a magnitude plot and a phase plot that describe how the system responds to sinusoidal inputs of varying frequency. For a linear time-invariant (LTI) system, the Bode plot uniquely characterizes how input signals are attenuated or amplified and how much phase delay is introduced as a function of frequency.
The Bode plot provides insights that cannot be obtained from time-domain waveforms alone. While time-domain tests (step, square, triangle, and sine inputs) reveal transient and steady-state behavior, the Bode plot directly exposes the system’s gain roll-off, phase lag, and bandwidth, which are the critical quantities governing closed-loop stability. In particular, the Bode plot allows identification of the gain crossover frequency, where loop gain approaches unity, and forms the basis for reasoning about stability margins.
In this project, the plant is a first-order RC network, which behaves as a low-pass system. The experimentally measured Bode magnitude confirms significant attenuation (approximately −12 dB) at the operating frequency of 2.5–2.6 Hz, indicating that the system is operating beyond its cutoff region. This attenuation is not evident from time-domain waveforms alone but becomes immediately clear in the frequency domain. The agreement between the measured sine-wave gain and the theoretical RC Bode curve validates the plant model used for controller design.
The Bode plot directly motivates the use of an active PID controller in this system. Since the RC plant attenuates signals and introduces phase lag, the controller must provide sufficient gain to compensate for this attenuation and, through derivative action, partially offset phase lag near the crossover frequency. By examining the plant’s Bode characteristics, the required controller gain for unity loop-gain operation can be estimated, ensuring that controller tuning is grounded in the physical dynamics of the system rather than empirical trial-and-error.
